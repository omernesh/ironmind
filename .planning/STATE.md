Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-27 - Completed 01-05-PLAN.md (Frontend-Backend Auth Integration)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 50.0 min (50 min)
- Total execution time: 4.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-infrastructure-foundation | 5/5 | 4.3h | 52m |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2.1h), 01-03 (11.7m), 01-02 (1.3h), 01-04 (14m), 01-05 (30m)
- Trend: Consistent execution speed, complex integration tasks ~30-60min, setup tasks ~12-15min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Architecture: txtai for RAG backend (lightweight, native hybrid search)
- Architecture: FalkorDB for knowledge graph (lighter than Neo4j, POC-appropriate)
- Architecture: docling-serve API (separate service for document processing)
- Architecture: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (cost-effective embeddings)
- Architecture: Mistral rerank via DeepInfra (30-50% precision boost)
- Architecture: Hybrid RAG (BM25 + embeddings for technical docs)
- Architecture: OpenAI GPT-5-mini (latest model, faster than GPT-4)
- Timeline: 5-day deadline (Feb 1, 2026) requires aggressive execution

**From 01-01 execution:**
- Implementation: Pydantic-settings for environment configuration
- Implementation: Structlog with JSON output for production, console for development
- Implementation: BaseHTTPMiddleware for request logging (avoids async context issues)
- Implementation: Middleware order: CORS → CorrelationID → RequestLogging
- Implementation: Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers for production deployment
- Implementation: Non-root user (appuser) in Docker for security

**From 01-02 execution:**
- Implementation: Better Auth with SQLite for POC simplicity (no Postgres required)
- Implementation: Email verification disabled for POC speed (requireEmailVerification: false)
- Implementation: 7-day session expiry with cookie-based persistence
- Implementation: TypeScript types required for better-sqlite3 native module
- Implementation: Multi-stage Docker build with native module compilation support

**From 01-03 execution:**
- Implementation: FastAPI Depends injection for JWT validation (not global middleware)
- Implementation: Extract user_id from 'sub' claim (Better Auth convention)
- Implementation: Structlog context binding for user_id in logs
- Implementation: Optional authentication dependency for mixed endpoints
- Implementation: HS256 algorithm for JWT (symmetric key)

**From 01-04 execution:**
- Implementation: Shared AUTH_SECRET for JWT validation between frontend and backend
- Implementation: Docker Compose override pattern for development with volume mounts
- Implementation: FalkorDB with --protected-mode no for POC (no password)
- Implementation: Named network (ironmind-network) for service-to-service communication
- Implementation: Service health checks with depends_on for startup ordering

**From 01-05 execution:**
- Implementation: Token exchange pattern (Better Auth session -> JWT token via /api/auth/backend-token)
- Implementation: Jose library for JWT creation (ESM-native, Next.js compatible)
- Implementation: 15-minute token expiry with 1-minute refresh buffer and in-memory caching
- Implementation: Manual database schema creation (Better Auth v1.4.17 doesn't auto-create)
- Implementation: WAL mode enabled for better SQLite concurrency
- Implementation: Browser uses localhost:8000, server-side uses backend:8000 for API calls

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 Risks:**

- Docling integration requires Day 1 validation on actual aerospace documents
- ~~Better Auth configuration complexity may delay auth implementation~~ **RESOLVED:** Better Auth configured with SQLite (01-02)
- ~~Docker Compose orchestration with 4+ services needs testing~~ **RESOLVED:** Docker Compose verified with all services healthy (01-04)
- ~~End-to-end auth flow needs verification~~ **RESOLVED:** Complete auth flow verified in 01-05 (register -> login -> dashboard -> backend API -> logout)

**Phase 4 Risks (Research Flag):**

- Knowledge graph entity extraction quality highly domain-dependent
- 70% accuracy threshold may be difficult to achieve without manual tuning
- Research suggests 30-40% incorrect edges without entity resolution

**Phase 6 Risks (Research Flag):**

- LobeChat-custom backend integration pattern less documented
- IAI branding customization depth unknown
